# WhatsForm Finance Tracker

Local development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The project uses Vite + React (TypeScript). The main component is `finance-tracker-form.tsx` at the repository root and is imported by `src/App.tsx`.

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If you want Tailwind styles, I can add a Tailwind config and setup — ask and I'll add it.
